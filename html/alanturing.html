    <h1>Alan Turing</h1>
    <p>Alan Turing is considered the father of computer science. 
        He attended <a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/">Oxford University</a> as a 
        mathematics major. For his thesis, he wrote about 
        <strong>Turing machines</strong>, which are machines that manipulate 
        symbols on a strip of paper according to a table of rules. This concept
        is the earliest idea of a computing machine and inspired the invention 
        of the modern electronic computer.
